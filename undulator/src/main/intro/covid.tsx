        <p>We are looking to the NZ Event Sector Voluntary Code and sporting bodies for best practice expectations based on the Ministry of Health guidance.  This will include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>contact tracing (QR codes for the covid app)</li>
            <li>compulsory mask-wearing at start/finish areas</li>
            <li>{compulsory}</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will provide updates as things develop, here and on the website, and communicate race-day measures ahead of time. </p>

        <p>Please get vaccinated, stay safe and keep training!</p>
